# Podman

[Podman](http://podman.io/) is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative ([OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/)) [Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/#h.j2uq93kgxe0e) and [Container Images](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/#h.dqlu6589ootw). Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker [Container Engine](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/#h.6yt1ex5wfo3l). Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common [Container Engines](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/#h.6yt1ex5wfo3l) (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant [Container Runtime](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/#h.6yt1ex5wfo55) (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

Containers under the control of Podman can either be run by root or by a non-privileged user. Podman manages the entire container ecosystem which includes pods, containers, container images, and container volumes using the [libpod](https://github.com/containers/podman) library. Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify OCI container images, such as pulling and tagging. It allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers and container images in a production environment.

The Podman service runs only on Linux platforms, however a REST API and clients are currently under development which will allow Mac and Windows platforms to call the service. There is currently a RESTful based remote client which runs on Mac or Windows platforms that allows the remote client to talk to the Podman server on a Linux platform. In addition to those clients, there is also a Mac client.\


To summarize, Podman makes it easy to find, run, build and share containers.

* Find: whether finding a container on dockerhub.io or quay.io, an internal registry server, or directly from a vendor, a couple of [podman search](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-search.1.html), and [podman pull](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-pull.1.html) commands make it easy
* Run: itâ€™s easy to consume pre-built images with everything needed to run an entire application, or start from a Linux distribution base image with the [podman run](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html) command
* Build: creating new layers with small tweaks, or major overhauls is easy with [podman build](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html)
* Share: Podman lets you push your newly built containers anywhere you want with a single [podman push](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-push.1.html) command
