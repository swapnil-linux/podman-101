# podman run

Now that we have everything setup, itâ€™s time to get our hands dirty. In this section, you are going to run an Alpine Linux container (a lightweight Linux distribution) on your system and get a taste of the podman run command.

```
[root@servera ~]# podman run docker.io/alpine echo hello world
Trying to pull docker.io/alpine...

hello world
```

`podman run` does 3 things

1. pulls the images if it's not already available on the system
2. creates the namespaces
3. and launches the process in the namespace, in this case, its `echo hello world`

The container terminates if the primary process of the container, to get the list of running containers use `podman ps`

```
[root@servera ~]# podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE  COMMAND  CREATED  STATUS  PORTS  NAMES
```

and to get the list of all containers, running or exited use `podman ps -a`

```
[root@servera ~]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                            COMMAND           CREATED        STATUS                    PORTS  NAMES
8adc741e3e28  docker.io/library/alpine:latest  echo hello world  6 minutes ago  Exited (0) 6 minutes ago         tender_wu
```

Let's understand the output of the command

* CONTAINER ID - A unique ID is assigned to each container. Containers can be referred to either using names or ID
* IMAGE - alpine image used to create this container
* COMMAND - the process that started while starting this container.&#x20;
* CREATED - when this container was created&#x20;
* STATUS - shows the current status of container, Exited in our case and so it was not listed with podman ps
* PORTS - Exposed ports of the application running in the container.&#x20;
* NAMES - A name given to container to be used to manage it using a name instead of CONTAINER ID

{% hint style="info" %}
NAMES are randomly generated by combining a list of adjectives like adoring, admiring, angry, tender... to a list of notable scientists and hackers.&#x20;

To run a shell (Terminal) as a process in a container we need to run the process in and interactive way and allocate a pseudo-TTY

```
[root@servera ~]# podman run -it --name=myubuntu docker.io/ubuntu bash
Trying to pull docker.io/ubuntu...

root@c378d88d23f9:/# 
```

* `-i, --interactive` Keep STDIN open even if not attached&#x20;
* `-t, --tty` Allocate a pseudo-TTY for container&#x20;
* `--name string` Assign a name to the container

running podman ps in another terminal will show running container

```
[root@servera ~]# podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                            COMMAND  CREATED        STATUS            PORTS  NAMES
c378d88d23f9  docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest  bash     3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes ago         myubuntu
```
